## What is a **Modmail** bot ? How does it work?

**Answer** : ModMail is a **feature-rich Discord bot** designed to enable your server members to contact staff easily. <p> A new channel under a category **Modmail Tickets** is created whenever a user messages the bot, and the channel will serve as a shared inbox for seamless communication between staff and the user.</p>

## Why is it's name **Layeeque's Hangout** ?

**Answer** : The answer is pretty straight-forward but as a story :p . I had no idea or intention for making it but one day, my friend <code>Layeeque</code> saw me coding a file named <code> mod.py</code> in VS Code through my Discord's RPC. He just casually asked that, "Can U make Modmail bots?". My answer was, "Maybe? I haven't tried that!". He asked me to give it a try and i did it for his server specifically. So yea, this is how this bot got it's name. ðŸ˜…
